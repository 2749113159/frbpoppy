    Return random variables distributed according to power law.

    The power law distribution power p is defined as dN(x)/dlogx ∝ L^p or dN(x)/dL ∝ x^(p-1), which after integration, is identical to the index in the cumulative distribution N(>x) ∝ x^p. 
    It can be measured as the slope in the log-log plot of N(>x)-x. See Wang & van Leeuwen (2024) for detals.
    A flat powerlaw can therefore be created by taking setting power to zero.

    Args:
        low (float): low limit of distribution
        high (float): Higher limit of distribution
        power (float): Power of power law distribution
        shape (int/tuple): Shape of array to be generated. Can also be a int.
